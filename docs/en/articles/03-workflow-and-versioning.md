# Data Contract Versioning: An Architectural Vision

Data contract versioning represents a major architectural challenge, where technical change management must harmonize with evolving business needs. My experience in designing data platforms has shown that the key lies in a layered approach that separates concerns while maintaining overall coherence.

## Versioning Fundamentals 

Managing data contract versions goes far beyond simple semantic versioning. It requires a deep understanding of the impact of changes across the entire data chain. Let's look at a concrete example of versioning definition:

```yaml
versioning:
  current_version: 2.1.0
  compatibility:
    backward_compatible: true
    support_window: "90 days"
  change_log:
    - version: 2.1.0
      type: "field_addition"
      field: "customer_segment" 
      impact: "non-breaking"
```

This definition establishes a clear framework for change management, but its true value emerges in its application across the data architecture.

## Types of Changes

It is crucial to distinguish two types of evolution:

### Contract Evolution

```sql
-- Quality rules update without data impact
UPDATE contract_registry 
SET contract_version = '2.1.0',
    quality_rules = quality_rules || new_rules
WHERE contract_id = 'customer_profile';
```

### Schema Evolution 

```sql
-- Data migration with new schema
CREATE TABLE customer_profile_v2 AS
SELECT 
  id,
  -- schema transformations
FROM customer_profile_v1;
```

## Impact on Medallion Architecture

In a modern medallion architecture, each layer plays a specific role in version management. Let's consider the evolution of a customer schema across different layers.

### Bronze: History Capture

The bronze layer preserves data in its original format, with explicit partitioning by version. This simple yet powerful approach ensures the ability to trace the complete history of data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE bronze.customer_profile (
    raw_data STRUCT<...>,
    contract_version STRING,
    ingestion_timestamp TIMESTAMP
)
PARTITIONED BY (contract_version);
```

### Silver: The Intelligence Layer

This is where the magic happens. We implement transformation logic that harmonizes different versions. Here's an eloquent example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW silver.unified_customer_profile AS
SELECT  
    CASE contract_version
        WHEN '1.0' THEN extract_v1_address(raw_data)
        WHEN '2.0' THEN extract_v2_address(raw_data)
    END as normalized_address,
    -- Other version-specific transformations
FROM bronze.customer_profile;
```

This view unifies different schema versions, providing a consistent interface to upper layers.

### Gold: The Business Interface

The gold layer exposes data in a format optimized for business consumption while maintaining compatibility with existing systems:

```sql
CREATE VIEW gold.current_customer_profile AS
SELECT * FROM silver.unified_customer_profile
WHERE contract_version = current_version();

CREATE VIEW gold.legacy_customer_profile AS
SELECT  
    -- Legacy format reconstruction for compatibility
    address_line1 || ', ' || city as full_address
FROM silver.unified_customer_profile;
```

## Migration Strategies

Migration management is a critical aspect of versioning. Our approach is based on three fundamental principles:

1. Temporary version coexistence
2. Progressive data transformation
3. Continuous quality validation

These principles materialize in our change deployment strategy. For a customer schema modification, we proceed in stages:

```sql
-- Step 1: Add new fields without impact
ALTER TABLE customer_profile  
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS customer_segment STRING;

-- Step 2: Progressive data population
UPDATE customer_profile
SET customer_segment = derive_segment(historical_data)
WHERE customer_segment IS NULL;

-- Step 3: Quality validation
SELECT quality_check_results
FROM validate_profile_completeness();
```

## Governance and Monitoring

A robust versioning architecture requires clear governance and continuous monitoring. We particularly monitor:

* Usage of different contract versions
* Data quality metrics by version
* Transformation times between versions
* Impact on consumer systems

## Active Multiversioning Management

In production, versioning reality is often more complex than a simple linear transition from one version to another. Our systems must simultaneously manage multiple active versions of the same contract, each with its own lifecycle. Let's take an example of a customer profile contract:

```sql
-- Active version management view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW version_lifecycle AS
SELECT  
    contract_version,
    release_date,
    end_of_support_date,
    CASE  
        WHEN end_of_support_date < CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '90 days'  
        THEN 'sunset_warning'
        WHEN end_of_support_date < CURRENT_DATE  
        THEN 'deprecated'
        ELSE 'active'
    END as lifecycle_status,
    COUNT(DISTINCT consumer_id) as active_consumers
FROM contract_registry
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3;
```

## Field Reality

In practice, multiversioning management is a constant balancing act. Here are some key principles from my experience:

1. Keep the number of active versions manageable. The more versions you maintain in parallel, the higher the operational complexity. A good ratio is not to maintain more than three major versions simultaneously.

2. Establish a clear end-of-support policy. End-of-support dates shouldn't be arbitrary but based on consumers' real ability to migrate.

3. Prioritize automation of transformations between versions. Each manual transformation is a potential source of errors.

4. Invest in telemetry. The ability to understand how your versions are used is crucial for effective lifecycle management.

In the next article, we'll explore architecture patterns that facilitate this multiversioning management, particularly efficient storage strategies and progressive migration approaches.
