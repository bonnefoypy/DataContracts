# Data Contracts: From Friction to Flow

It's 3 AM. The support team receives a critical alert: the data pipeline feeding the real-time sales dashboard is down. Preliminary analysis reveals that the e-commerce team modified the order data format without notice. A mandatory field has been renamed, and now the entire processing chain is paralyzed.

This situation is unfortunately not an isolated case. In many organizations, data teams spend more time managing surprises and incompatibilities than creating value. The symptoms are familiar:

## Daily Life Without Data Contracts

Imagine a growing e-commerce company. Several teams work in parallel on different parts of the system:

The e-commerce team manages the sales platform and generates transaction data. The data science team develops recommendation models. The BI team produces reports for management. The marketing team leverages customer data for campaigns.

On the surface, everything works. But beneath the surface, it's chaos:

Data engineers spend their days fixing broken pipelines because a field has changed type or name. Data scientists discover their models are producing erroneous results due to silent changes in input data. The BI team must constantly verify if metrics are still calculated the same way.

Meetings are filled with questions like: "Who changed this field?", "Why is the data different today?", "How are we supposed to use this column?"

## The Hidden Cost of Missing Contracts

This situation has a real cost, often underestimated:

- Business decisions made on incorrect data
- Hours lost in debugging and reconciliation
- Data projects falling behind schedule
- Loss of trust in data
- Team stress and frustration

This situation becomes even more critical in a Data Mesh context, where data responsibility is decentralized to business domains. Let's take the example of a bank I recently assisted in their Data Mesh transformation. Each domain - credit, savings, insurance - became responsible for their own data. Without data contracts, this decentralization initially amplified the problems: inconsistencies multiplied, traceability became a nightmare, and trust in data eroded.

On average, teams spent 40% of their time managing these coordination and quality issues. It's like building a house where each craftsman would use their own units of measurement, but at the scale of an entire city.

## Data as a Product and the Emergence of Data Contracts

In a Data Mesh model, each business domain becomes a true data product provider. This "Data as a Product" approach fundamentally transforms how we think about data: it's no longer just a byproduct of our systems, but a product in its own right, with its own quality requirements, documentation, and support.

Imagine a "Credit" domain in our bank. As a data producer, it doesn't just push raw data into a data lake. It must:
- Guarantee data quality and freshness
- Provide clear and up-to-date documentation
- Ensure support for consumers
- Manage product evolution over time
- Measure and improve user satisfaction

It's in this context that data contracts emerged as a structured response to these challenges. They formalize the commitments of data producers to their consumers, transforming an often vague relationship into a clear and measurable partnership.

Let's take a concrete example. In our e-commerce company, a data contract for order data would look like this:

```yaml
name: order_events
version: 2.0.0
owner: e-commerce-team
description: "Stream of order events from the e-commerce platform"

schema:
  order_id: uuid
  customer_id: string
  items: array
  total_amount: decimal(10,2)
  status: enum(pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered)

quality:
  - rule: "total_amount must equal sum of item prices"
  - rule: "status transitions must follow defined workflow"

sla:
  latency: "< 5 minutes"
  availability: 99.9%
   
changes:
  process: "RFC required for breaking changes"
  notification: "2 weeks notice for schema updates"
```

This contract becomes a formal commitment between the e-commerce team that produces the data and all the teams that consume it. It defines not only the data structure but also quality and service guarantees.

## The Transformation in Action

When this same company started adopting data contracts, the changes were remarkable:

- Data science teams can now automatically detect if input data meets their requirements
- Schema changes follow a controlled process, with a notice period
- Quality issues are detected and fixed before impacting downstream systems
- New teams can quickly understand and use the data

Most impressive? Time spent managing coordination issues dropped from 40% to less than 10%.

## Where to Start?

In a Data Mesh context, data contract adoption must align with domain maturity as data producers. I've observed that organizations succeed better when they:

1. Identify a mature and motivated business domain to pilot the initiative. In our bank, the Credit team played this role, creating a concrete example for other domains.

2. Start with a critical data product having multiple consumers. The validated credit requests flow was perfect: critical data, multiple consumers, clear quality needs.

3. Establish a short feedback loop with consumers. Data scientists using this data for scoring provided valuable feedback on required attributes and their quality constraints.

4. Progressively automate validations and monitoring, transforming the contract into a living tool rather than static documentation.

5. Document and share successes to create a snowball effect. When other domains saw the reduction in incidents and improvement in consumer satisfaction, they naturally wanted to adopt the approach.

The goal is not immediate perfection, but to establish a new standard for collaboration around data.

## Conclusion

Data contracts are not just a technical tool - they represent a new way of thinking about data collaboration. They transform implicit agreements into explicit and automatable commitments.

In the next article, we'll explore in detail how to structure these contracts to maximize their value while minimizing friction for teams. We'll see how to manage versioning, migrations, and special cases that emerge in practice.
