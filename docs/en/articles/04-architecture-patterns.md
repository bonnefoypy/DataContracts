# Architecture Patterns for Data Contracts

The successful implementation of data contracts relies on proven architecture patterns that facilitate their management and evolution. Through my implementation experiences, I've identified several key patterns that consistently emerge in mature data architectures.

## Medallion Architecture and Versioning

The medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) provides a natural framework for managing data contract versions. Here's how each layer contributes to a robust versioning strategy:

```sql
-- Structure enabling data multiversioning
CREATE TABLE bronze.customer_events (
    event_id UUID,
    event_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    customer_id STRING,
    -- Version-specific data
    v1_format STRUCT<
        name: STRING,
        address: STRING,  -- Combined format
        status: STRING    -- Short codes (A, I, P)
    >,
    v2_format STRUCT<
        full_name: STRING,
        address_components: STRUCT<
            street: STRING,
            city: STRING,
            country: STRING
        >,
        status: STRING    -- Detailed formats (ACTIVE, INACTIVE, PENDING)
    >,
    v3_format STRUCT<
        full_name: STRING,
        address_components: STRUCT<
            street: STRING,
            city: STRING,
            country: STRING,
            geo: STRUCT<lat: DOUBLE, lon: DOUBLE>
        >,
        status: STRING,
        preferences: ARRAY<STRING>
    >,
    -- Versioning metadata
    contract_version STRING,
    processing_version STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY (contract_version);
```

### Bronze Layer: Raw Data Preservation

The bronze layer implements several critical patterns:

1. **Version Partitioning**
   - Each version is stored in its own partition
   - Original data format is preserved
   - Complete history is maintained

2. **Schema Evolution**
   - New versions coexist with old ones
   - Non-destructive updates
   - Backward compatibility support

### Silver Layer: Transformation Logic

The silver layer manages version compatibility:

```sql
-- Version-specific views for consumers
CREATE VIEW v1_customer_view AS
SELECT  
    customer_id,
    v1_format.*
FROM customer_events
WHERE contract_version = '1.0'
AND processing_version = (
    SELECT max(processing_version)
    FROM customer_events
    WHERE contract_version = '1.0'
);

-- V1 compatibility view for v2 data
CREATE VIEW v1_compatibility_view AS
SELECT  
    customer_id,
    v2_format.full_name as name,
    concat_ws(', ',  
        v2_format.address_components.street,
        v2_format.address_components.city
    ) as address,
    CASE v2_format.status
        WHEN 'ACTIVE' THEN 'A'
        WHEN 'INACTIVE' THEN 'I'
        WHEN 'PENDING' THEN 'P'
    END as status
FROM customer_events
WHERE contract_version = '2.0';
```

### Gold Layer: Business Views

The gold layer focuses on business value:

1. **Unified Views**
   - Consistent business interface
   - Version-agnostic access
   - Optimized for analysis

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Data validation rules
   - SLA monitoring
   - Usage analytics

## Monitoring and Alerting

Effective version management requires robust monitoring:

```sql
-- Detection of versions approaching end of support
CREATE VIEW version_sunset_alerts AS
WITH version_usage AS (
    SELECT  
        contract_version,
        end_of_support_date,
        array_agg(DISTINCT consumer_system) as affected_systems,
        count(DISTINCT event_id) as daily_events
    FROM contract_registry r
    JOIN usage_metrics u USING (contract_version)
    WHERE u.event_date >= current_date - interval '7 days'
    GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT  
    contract_version,
    end_of_support_date,
    affected_systems,
    daily_events,
    date_diff('day', current_date, end_of_support_date) as days_until_sunset,
    CASE  
        WHEN end_of_support_date < current_date + interval '30 days' THEN 'CRITICAL'
        WHEN end_of_support_date < current_date + interval '90 days' THEN 'WARNING'
        ELSE 'INFO'
    END as alert_level
FROM version_usage
WHERE end_of_support_date IS NOT NULL;
```

## Implementation Best Practices

1. **Schema Design**
   - Use flexible data types
   - Plan for extensibility
   - Document constraints clearly

2. **Version Management**
   - Implement clear versioning strategy
   - Maintain compatibility layers
   - Plan for deprecation

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize storage layout
   - Index critical fields
   - Monitor query patterns

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test transformations thoroughly
   - Validate data quality after migrations
   - Maintain representative test datasets

## Reference Implementation

The architectural patterns are implemented in:

- [SQL](../../../sql/)
  - [Bronze Layer](../../../sql/bronze/customer_events.sql)
  - [Silver Layer](../../../sql/silver/customer_views.sql)
  - [Monitoring](../../../sql/monitoring/version_monitoring.sql)
- [Validation](../../../validation/version_migration.py)

## Conclusion

Architecture patterns for data contracts must balance flexibility and control. Good architecture not only effectively manages current versions but also anticipates and facilitates future evolution.
