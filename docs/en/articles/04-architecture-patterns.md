# Architecture Patterns for Data Contracts

The successful implementation of data contracts relies on proven architecture patterns that facilitate their management and evolution. Through my implementation experiences across different organizations, I have identified several key patterns that consistently emerge in mature data architectures.

## Medallion Architecture and Versioning

The medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) provides a natural framework for managing data contract versions. This approach is not just a simple data organization - it's a strategy that effectively manages contract evolution while maintaining compatibility with existing systems.

### Bronze: The Source of Truth

The bronze layer plays a fundamental role: it preserves the complete history of data in its original format. This approach offers several critical advantages:
- Ability to trace the complete evolution of data
- Possibility to replay transformations if necessary
- Solid foundation for audit and compliance

```sql
CREATE TABLE bronze.customer_events (
    event_id UUID,
    event_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    customer_id STRING,
    -- Version-specific data
    v1_format STRUCT<
        name: STRING,
        address: STRING,  -- Combined format
        status: STRING    -- Short codes (A, I, P)
    >,
    v2_format STRUCT<
        full_name: STRING,
        address_components: STRUCT<
            street: STRING,
            city: STRING,
            country: STRING
        >,
        status: STRING    -- Detailed formats
    >,
    -- Essential metadata
    contract_version STRING,
    processing_version STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY (contract_version);
```

This structure is not arbitrary - it reflects a deep understanding of versioning requirements. Partitioning by contract version enables efficient performance management while maintaining traceability.

### Silver: The Intelligence Layer

The silver layer is the heart of our versioning strategy. This is where we implement the logic that reconciles different contract versions. This layer must be designed with particular attention to:
- Transformation performance
- Mapping rule maintenance
- Edge case management

```sql
-- Unified customer profile view
CREATE VIEW silver.unified_customer_profile AS
SELECT  
    CASE contract_version
        WHEN '1.0' THEN extract_v1_address(raw_data)
        WHEN '2.0' THEN extract_v2_address(raw_data)
    END as normalized_address,
    -- Other version-specific transformations
FROM bronze.customer_profile;
```

This approach enables gradual schema evolution while maintaining compatibility with existing systems.

### Gold: The Access Layer

The gold layer is the data access layer. It must be designed to be performant and secure.

```sql
-- Data access view
CREATE VIEW gold.customer_data_access AS
SELECT  
    customer_id,
    contract_version,
    event_timestamp,
    v1_format.name,
    v1_format.address,
    v1_format.status,
    v2_format.full_name,
    v2_format.address_components,
    v2_format.status,
    v3_format.address_components,
    v3_format.status,
    v3_format.preferences
FROM bronze.customer_events
WHERE contract_version IN ('1.0', '2.0', '3.0');
```

## Pattern: Compatibility Views

Managing compatibility views is a major challenge in data contract evolution. The objective is twofold: allow existing consumers to continue functioning without modification while encouraging migration to new versions.

### Backward Compatibility Strategy

Creating compatibility views is not just a technical exercise - it's a migration strategy that must consider:
- Performance impact
- Maintenance complexity
- Consumer-specific needs

```sql
-- Version-specific views for consumers
CREATE VIEW v1_customer_view AS
SELECT  
    customer_id,
    v1_format.*
FROM customer_events
WHERE contract_version = '1.0'
AND processing_version = (
    SELECT max(processing_version)
    FROM customer_events
    WHERE contract_version = '1.0'
);
```

This view ensures that version 1 consumers continue to receive data in the expected format, even as underlying data evolves.

### Transformation Management

Transformations between versions must be carefully designed to preserve data semantics:

```sql
CREATE VIEW v1_compatibility_view AS
SELECT  
    customer_id,
    v2_format.full_name as name,
    concat_ws(', ',  
        v2_format.address_components.street,
        v2_format.address_components.city
    ) as address,
    CASE v2_format.status
        WHEN 'ACTIVE' THEN 'A'
        WHEN 'INACTIVE' THEN 'I'
        WHEN 'PENDING' THEN 'P'
    END as status
FROM customer_events
WHERE contract_version = '2.0';
```

This bidirectional transformation approach enables harmonious version coexistence while facilitating gradual migrations.

## Pattern: Alerting and Monitoring System

A robust alerting system is crucial for maintaining the health of the data contract ecosystem. It's not just about detecting problems, but providing the necessary context for quick and effective action.

### Proactive Problem Detection

The alerting system must anticipate problems before they impact consumers:

```sql
CREATE VIEW version_sunset_alerts AS
WITH version_usage AS (
    SELECT  
        contract_version,
        end_of_support_date,
        array_agg(DISTINCT consumer_system) as affected_systems,
        count(DISTINCT event_id) as daily_events
    FROM contract_registry r
    JOIN usage_metrics u USING (contract_version)
    WHERE u.event_date >= current_date - interval '7 days'
    GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT  
    contract_version,
    end_of_support_date,
    affected_systems,
    daily_events,
    date_diff('day', current_date, end_of_support_date) as days_until_sunset,
    CASE  
        WHEN end_of_support_date < current_date + interval '30 days' THEN 'CRITICAL'
        WHEN end_of_support_date < current_date + interval '90 days' THEN 'WARNING'
        ELSE 'INFO'
    END as alert_level
FROM version_usage
WHERE end_of_support_date IS NOT NULL;
```

This view doesn't just report end-of-life versions - it provides the complete context necessary for migration planning:
- Identification of impacted systems
- Volume of affected data
- Migration urgency

### Usage Monitoring

Usage monitoring goes beyond simple technical metrics. It must enable understanding of usage patterns and anticipation of future needs:

```sql
-- Version usage monitoring
CREATE VIEW version_usage_metrics AS
SELECT  
    contract_version,
    date_trunc('hour', event_timestamp) as hour,
    count(*) as event_count,
    count(DISTINCT customer_id) as unique_customers,
    count(DISTINCT consumer_system) as unique_consumers,
    avg(processing_latency) as avg_latency
FROM customer_events
WHERE event_timestamp >= current_date - interval '7 days'
GROUP BY 1, 2;
```

These metrics enable:
- Identifying most used versions
- Detecting adoption trends
- Optimizing performance based on usage patterns
- Planning future capacity

## Pattern: Migration Management

Migration between versions is often the most delicate point in a data contract's life. A gradual and controlled approach is essential to minimize risks and disruptions.

### Migration Strategy

The migration strategy must consider several critical aspects:
- Impact on production systems
- Ability to rollback in case of problems
- Validation of migrated data
- Coordination with consumer teams

```python
class VersionMigrationManager:
    def __init__(self, source_version, target_version):
        self.source = source_version
        self.target = target_version
        self.migration_state = {}
        
    def plan_migration(self):
        """Analyzes impact and plans migration"""
        impact = self.analyze_breaking_changes()
        if impact.is_breaking:
            return self.create_migration_plan()
```

This structured approach enables:
1. Evaluating impact before any migration
2. Creating a detailed migration plan
3. Identifying potential risks
4. Preparing contingency plans

### Execution and Validation

Migration execution must be gradual and controlled:

```python
def execute_migration(self, batch_size=1000):
    """Executes migration in batches"""
    while not self.is_migration_complete():
        batch = self.get_next_batch(batch_size)
        self.migrate_batch(batch)
        self.validate_batch(batch)
```

This batch approach enables:
- Limiting impact on production systems
- Validating each migration step
- Quickly detecting and correcting problems
- Maintaining data quality

## Best Practices and Lessons Learned

Through numerous implementations, certain practices have proven particularly effective:

1. **Version Isolation**
   Clear separation of versions in the bronze layer is not just about organization - it's a guarantee of stability and traceability. It enables:
   - Maintaining historical data integrity
   - Facilitating audits and compliance
   - Simplifying rollback when needed

2. **Proactive Monitoring**
   Monitoring should not be reactive but anticipatory. It should enable:
   - Detecting problematic trends before they become critical
   - Identifying optimization opportunities
   - Guiding evolution decisions

3. **Documentation and Communication**
   Technical documentation is not enough. Maintain:
   - Clear history of architectural decisions
   - Detailed migration guides
   - Effective communication channels with consumers

## Conclusion

Architecture patterns for data contracts must balance flexibility and control. Good architecture doesn't just efficiently manage current versions - it anticipates and facilitates future evolution. Success lies in combining robust technical patterns with a deep understanding of business needs and operational constraints.
